Add a Task Manager button to the Settings-Personality-Taskbar-Taskbar item so that the Task Manager can reside on the taskbar.

Although users can add it by themselves, I still recommend doing so as a function entry at the same level as search and multi-task management. This will resolve a recurring user request to restore the Task Manager option in the taskbar right-click menu.
