Black is the color when the monitor is turned off. Logically speaking, if a system is not fully started before, it should use a black background to distinguish it from the gorgeous interface after startup, just like the hierarchical structure of a book's cover-title page-table of contents-text. So it's a little weird that it's in blue now, I think a black background would be a better choice.
